## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository
- Update the `pageUrl` properties in the **config/serve.json** file
  - The `pageUrl` should be a modern page
  - This property is only used during development in conjunction with the `gulp serve` command
- In the command line navigate to the `react-command-addfolders` folder and run:
  - `npm install`
  - `gulp serve`
- If you have `spfx-fast-serve` already installed, run `npm run serve` instead of `gulp serve`

## Features

This extension illustrates the following concepts:

- Adding folders nested or not (batching process if not)
- Working on both libraries and lists
- Checking permissions and enable folder creation option
- Checking folder name regarding SharePoint / OneDrive specs
- Including a disposable Coachmark for guidance
- Available in English and French
- Developing the sample using React Hooks, Fluent UI and [spfx-fast-serve](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/spfx-fast-serve)
